# How to embed audio/video in Anki

No pop-up! Also proper audio controls.

The idea is to create a note type with a third hidden field where you formally embed it.

Then you use the better HTML tools on your actual note.

See [the well documented code](./src/main.rs) for a detailed explaination and example!

This is also possible without code by manually creating a new note type in Anki. If anyone wants to document it, please create a Pull Request! If one needs help doing that, just reach out at `lars@MY USERNAME.de
